#This class creates an Urn object with a set number of balls. It assigns the balls number so that each condition
#will have equal number of balls by accessing the previous trials from the csv. If it is the first trial, it creates
#a csv. It then creates a random distribution for the random urn and assigns which urn is random
#The "randomUrnPlacementInstructions" method changes the instruction label to reflect the trial conditions
#The "result" method randomly picks a ball once the user has clicked on an urn
#"addToCSV" method adds the full line to the CSV at the end of the trial
